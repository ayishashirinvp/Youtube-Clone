# YouTube Clone

A simple YouTube Clone built using HTML and CSS as part of a web development project. This project aims to replicate the basic layout and design of YouTube, focusing on user interface design.

## About This Project

This is my first project as a self-taught developer! I started learning web development with this project, inspired and guided by a YouTube video tutorial. It marks the beginning of my journey into the world of web development.

## Features

- **Page Design:** Includes a navigation bar, video thumbnails, and other key YouTube elements.
- **Custom Styling:** Uses CSS to mimic YouTube's design aesthetics.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the application.
- **CSS3**: For styling the application and making it visually appealing.

## Folder Structure
